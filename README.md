# News site 

This week‚Äôs project is to create a classic magazine or newspaper site. The focus is ‚úÖresponsive design and ‚úÖflexbox & ‚úÖGrid.

## The built & challanges
This week was a individual project focusing on creating our first landing page. Using CSS to layout the page and the following elements were included in the built

- flexbox & Grid to layout the page.
- A responsive design with the following views for new columns;  Desktop 4 columns, tablet 2 columns, mobile 1 column.
- The has a header, a main news article, a grid of news articles.
- Different hover effects was included , i.e. box shadow
- box shadow was to make the photos look like polaroids


üëâThe Challanges was mainly containing CSS grid, to make the boxes reponsive to the different views. For instance in tablet view the las news box spans over two grid columns. This involved a lot of youtube watching of Grid functionality a new concept for me. However I found Grid easier to align in a structured way when using milple similas boxes/cards to the page. I also used this time to try out animations in functionality in css such as ease in and ease out ‚≠êÔ∏è

More structure in the CSS file so it is easier to find different elements in the file
